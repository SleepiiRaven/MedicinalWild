<h2 align="center">
  In the year 1643, Lily was outcast from her village for being suspected to be a witch. She escaped capture and now she must survive out in the woods, with nothing to help her.

  Medicinal Wild is an cozy, environmental survival game about being a forager in the woods, collecting plants and brewing teas, and building a house for yourself. There are many realistic challenges that you will face, so there is no need for enemies, but you may turn the game to "Nightmare Mode" to add some frightening enemies.
